# Godot-RPG-1
My first project in Godot trying to achieve some level of interactivity and gameplay and trying to integrate RPG-Elements into the game, to test the interactions and the event-management (signals in godot)

The Assets used are from Kenney.nl, they offer great and free to use (also commercially) Assets for everyone.

# Current Version:

You can find the most recent build on: https://www.grinning-games.de/2d_rpg/2D%20RPG.html

This game right now is purely for experimentation. So dont expect to find much fun besides bugs and glitches. This is a learning project. Depending on the success, this could develop to a full fledged project.
