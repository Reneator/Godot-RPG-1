# Godot-RPG-1
My first project in Godot trying to achieve some level of interactivity and gameplay and trying to integrate RPG-Elements into the game, to test the interactions and the event-management (signals in godot)

The Assets used are from Kenney.nl, they offer great and free to use (also commercially) Assets for everyone.
