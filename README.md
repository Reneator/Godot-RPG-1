# Godot-RPG-1
My first project in Godot trying to achieve some level of interactivity and gameplay and trying to integrate RPG-Elements into the game, to test the interactions and the event-management (signals in godot)

The Assets used are from Kenney.nl, they offer great and free to use (also commercially) Assets for everyone.

# Current Version:

You can find the most recent build as html5 here: https://www.grinning-games.de/2d_rpg/2D%20RPG.html

To get the game working you could have to use a different browser. For me opera didnt work, but firefox did.

This game right now is purely for experimentation. So dont expect to find much fun besides bugs and glitches. This is a learning project. Depending on the success, this could develop to a full fledged project.

Asset-Packages used:

https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-extended-enemies
https://www.kenney.nl/assets/simplified-platformer-pack

Using InventoryExample to learn making an inventory, but i try to put my own spin to it.
